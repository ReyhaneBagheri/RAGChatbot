** RAGChatbot**  is an AI-powered chatbot that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate and context-aware responses. It retrieves relevant information from external documents before generating responses, ensuring high-quality answers.

This project is an intelligent text-based assistant designed to help students quickly access university information, such as academic schedules and regulations. Built using a RAG-based NLP model, it provides accurate, up-to-date answers to common questions without human intervention. Evaluations show a 91% accuracy rate, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving user experience and university service efficiency.

** 🧠 What is RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)?** 


RAG combines the power of retrieval and generation to produce accurate and informed answers from a large knowledge base.


** 🔍 Step 1: Retrieval** 


The system first retrieves relevant documents from a database or collection based on the user's question.


** ✍️ Step 2: Generation** 


Then, a language model (like BERT or GPT) uses the retrieved documents to generate a natural language answer.


** 🔄 Combined Workflow** 


RAG merges these two steps to answer questions more accurately than traditional chatbots.
