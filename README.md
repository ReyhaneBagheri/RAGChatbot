RAGChatbot is an AI-powered chatbot that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate and context-aware responses. It retrieves relevant information from external documents before generating responses, ensuring high-quality answers.

This project is an intelligent text-based assistant designed to help students quickly access university information, such as academic schedules and regulations. Built using a RAG-based NLP model, it provides accurate, up-to-date answers to common questions without human intervention. Evaluations show a 91% accuracy rate, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving user experience and university service efficiency.

🧠 What is RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)?
RAG combines the power of retrieval and generation to produce accurate and informed answers from a large knowledge base.
🔍 Step 1: Retrieval
The system first retrieves relevant documents from a database or collection based on the user's question.
✍️ Step 2: Generation
Then, a language model (like BERT or GPT) uses the retrieved documents to generate a natural language answer.
🔄 Combined Workflow
RAG merges these two steps to answer questions more accurately than traditional chatbots.
